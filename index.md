## Some wisdom

> The difference between theory and practice is greater in practice than in theory.

This quote is applicable to nearly *everything*, and software development is **not exempt.**

**Only through _experience_ can the gap between theory and practice shrink.**

To gain that experience, one must adopt a ~~fixed~~ **growth** mindset.

## Some code

Which of these two functions is better?
```
if (k < array[len - 1]) {
    k = array[len - 1];
}
```
```
int t = len - 1;
if (k < array[t]) {
    k = array[t];
}
```

The answer is not exactly straightforward. The use of the variable `int t` may not even have an effect on the code after compilation.
